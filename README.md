# Canada-Immigration

This analysis tells us about number of immigrants who have migrated to Canada over the past 30 years. This includes all the countries in the world. 
So the number of immigrants moving to Canada depends upon various factors like Education and Job opportunities. So we compare countries on the basis of how many 
immigrants have migrated in any particular year for example in 2001. We can also find out between multiple countries how many immigrants have been migrated over 
there. 

We can also modify our choices by providing inputs based on different criterias like from which continents the immigrants were most or least. We then plot the graph
for any random country and plot for all the years that they have provided immigrants to move to Canada. Even a line graph has been plotted in order to check for all
or many countries how many immigrants have they sent over a period of time or a particular time. We can also create a top trending graph with the major lead in the
countries in sending immigrants by plotting multiple line graph.

Thank You
